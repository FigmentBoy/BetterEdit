# On the Future of BetterEdit

> (Published 02/06/2023)

This is a brief announcement regarding the current and future state of BetterEdit as well as my other modding projects.

If it isn't obvious by my current Github activity (practically non-existent), I haven't done basically anything for a month. The reason is due to just real life stuff getting in the way. I also don't really know when my activity will resume, if ever. I am honestly currently quite burned out with modding - just opening VS Code immediately tires me and makes me want to do something else.

So, in short, **I haven't been working on BetterEdit in a while, I probably won't be working on it for a while, I don't know if I'll ever work on it actively again**.

However, I do want to note that [BetterEdit is open source](https://github.com/HJfod/BetterEdit), both the v4 and v5 versions - if anyone wants to contribute to the project, or fork it to create their own version, they are free to do so.

It is also notable that summer is starting up, and while most of my days will be spent stuck doing civil service, I will also be having a lot more free time, so it might be that I suddenly gain a massive boost of motivation and start pushing 40 commits per day. Probably not, though.

The reason for this short blog post is that I felt it would be dishonest to keep responding "yea I can add that" to feature requests when realistically I know that if I do get to adding the suggestion, 2.2 will already have been released and I have bigger problems.

That's about it.
