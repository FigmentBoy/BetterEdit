# BetterEdit

This is the branch for the v5 version of BetterEdit, which is only for [Geode](https://geode-sdk.org) - if you're looking for the old standalone version, see the [v4](https://github.com/HJfod/BetterEdit/tree/v4) and [v4-min](https://github.com/HJfod/BetterEdit/tree/v4-min) branches.

### Please note that BE 5 is still in very early stages of development, and many features are yet to be added.

BetterEdit 5 is currently available as an alpha version on both **Windows and Mac**. Android support is planned in the future.

If you'd like to try the next generation of BetterEdit out for yourself, you can get the latest binary from [releases](https://github.com/HJfod/BetterEdit/releases/tag/v5.0.0-alpha) (download `BetterEdit.geode`).
